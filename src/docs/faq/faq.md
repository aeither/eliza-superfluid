# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I deploy a Super Token?
- You can deploy a Wrapped Super Token using the [Super Token Factory contract](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/deploy-super-token/deploy-wrapped-super-token). A no-code interface is found on the same page of the docs.
- You can deploy a Pure Super Token using this [interface on the docs](/docs/protocol/super-tokens/guides/deploy-super-token/deploy-pure-super-token).

## How do I know if I should use simple Money Streaming or Distribution Pools?
- Use Money Streaming if you want to stream money from one account to another.
- Use Distribution Pools if you want to distribute money from one account to multiple accounts.
- Use Distribution Pools if you want to distribute money from multiple accounts to multiple accounts.

## What is a Super App and when should I use it?
A Super App is a smart contract that interacts with the Superfluid Protocol and creates automated hooks reacting to Stream actions (Streams started, Streams updated, Streams deleted).
If your application needs to start or end an action on-chain following a stream state update, you can create a Super App to automate this process.
Learn more about Super Apps in the [Superfluid Protocol documentation](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/super-apps).

## How can I deploy a Super App?
You can deploy a Super App using the [Super App Base Flow contract](/docs/protocol/advanced-topics/super-apps/deploy-a-super-app).

## How can I interact with the Superfluid Protocol on-chain?
The Superfluid Protocol is a token-centric protocol, meaning that all interactions are done through the `SuperTokenV1Library`.
To learn more about how to interact with the Superfluid Protocol on-chain, refer its [Technical Reference](/docs/technical-reference/SuperTokenV1Library.mdx).

## How can I interact with the Superfluid Protocol on the frontend?
The recommended way to interact with the Superfluid Protocol on the frontend is to use the Superfluid Contract Fowarders:
- For Money Streaming: Use the `CFAv1Forwarder` contract. To learn more about how to use it, refer to [CFAv1Forwarder](/docs/technical-reference/CFAv1Forwarder.mdx).
- For Distribution Pools: Use the `GDAv1Forwarder` contract. To learn more about how to use it, refer to [GDAv1Forwarder](/docs/technical-reference/GDAv1Forwarder.mdx).

## Where do I find the Superfluid Protocol addresses?
You can find the Superfluid Protocol addresses on the [Superfluid Explorer](https://Explorer.superfluid.finance/), under the tab "Protocol".

## Where do I find the Superfluid Subgraph playground and endpoints?
- You can find the Superfluid Subgraph playground on the [Superfluid Explorer](https://Explorer.superfluid.finance/), under the tab "Subgraph".
- You can find the Superfluid Subgraph endpoints on the [Superfluid Docs](/docs/technical-reference/subgraph).
