## Deploying a Custom Pure Super Token (Advanced)

Deploying a Pure Super Token allows for custom non-Superfluid logic integration.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Repository Setup**: Clone the [custom-supertokens repository](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/custom-supertokens#setup) and follow the setup instructions.
2. **Logic Selection**: Choose from existing logic examples or develop your own based on [PureSuperToken.sol](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/custom-supertokens/blob/main/contracts/PureSuperToken.sol).
3. **Deployment**: Create a .env file, configure it for your network, and follow the repository's deployment steps.

<Admonition type="note" title="Custom Logic Caution">

If developing custom logic, ensure to rename the contract in the .sol file to avoid conflicts during the build.
