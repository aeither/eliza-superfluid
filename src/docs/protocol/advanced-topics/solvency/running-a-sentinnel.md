# Running a Sentinel

In our section on [Liquidations & TOGA](./liquidations-and-toga.mdx), we described how the Superfluid protocol handles solvency & liquidations. Sentinels play a vital role in this process. This page provides links to various resources that will aid you on your journey to help secure the protocol üõ°‚öîÔ∏è

### Who Should Run a Sentinel?

1. Crypto enthusiasts who want to help secure a new, innovative primitive for web3 üòÅ
2. Teams that have a service running on Superfluid. Perhaps you‚Äôve launched your own dapp or your own Super Token, and you want to be 100% certain that your users are in good standing.
3. Professional operators who want to run profitable enterprises. If you have DevOps skills and/or you‚Äôre able to acquire capital to become the PIC for several tokens, participating in this process could be a good opportunity!

### Sentinel Repository

If you want to start running a Sentinel today, you can clone [this repo](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-sentinel) and customize your own `.env` file before starting the software. At minimum, you're going to need a reliable RPC URL, and a private key with native tokens to pay for gas when performing liquidations. Detailed instructions for running your Sentinel can be found in the repository's README and in the above video.

### Becoming the PIC

You can become the PIC by connecting your wallet at the [TOGA dashboard.](https://toga.superfluid.finance/) There, you'll also see information on the current PIC stake amount, stream data by token, and a real time list of all liquidations. TOGA contract addresses are also available in our [Explorer](https://Explorer.superfluid.finance/) for each network.
