# Stream Scheduler

## What’s the Stream Scheduler?

The Stream Scheduler is a Superfluid feature that enables you to:

1. Schedule the closing of an existing stream.
2. Schedule the start of a new stream.
3. Schedule both the start and end of a new stream.

This functionality is accessible directly from the Superfluid Dashboard after [approval for access](https://use.superfluid.finance/schedulestreams) and can also be implemented using underlying contracts and off-chain automations.

## Why Schedule Streams?

Scheduling streams offers automation for streams with fixed start and/or end dates. This is particularly useful for applications like payroll, subscriptions, and token vesting. By default, Superfluid streams are perpetual, running until manually canceled or until the balance is depleted. The Stream Scheduler allows for automated stream management, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

## Example:

Consider the following scenario, visualized in these [Miro diagrams](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP--AM4I=/?share_link_id=524959909457):

1. **Stream Scheduling**:
   On January 1st, you grant operator permissions to the Stream Scheduler contract and schedule a stream with the following details:
   
   - **Flow Rate**: 100 DAIx/mo.
   - **To**: Alice’s account
   - **Start**: March 1st, 2023, at 12:00 am
   - **End**: March 20th, 2023, at 12:00 am
   
   
   <br/>
   <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

   </div>

2. **Stream Initiation**:
   On March 1st, the scheduled stream from you to Alice commences.

   <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

   </div>

3. **Stream Cancellation**:
   On March 20th, the stream from you to Alice is automatically canceled.

## Setting Up Stream Scheduling

The Stream Scheduler is a versatile tool that enhances the functionality of Superfluid streams by automating their creation and termination based on predefined schedules.
This feature simplifies the management of streaming payments, especially in use cases like subscription services, vesting schedules, and regular disbursements.
