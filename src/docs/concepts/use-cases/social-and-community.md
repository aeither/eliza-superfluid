# Social & Community

Superfluid Protocol introduces innovative methods for community engagement and social token incentives, fostering long-term loyalty and participation.

## Gradual Social Token Incentives

Rather than distributing social tokens in a single airdrop, Superfluid enables a gradual, by-the-second streaming of tokens to community members or creator audiences.

### Concept

- **Long-Term Engagement**: This model rewards ongoing loyalty and engagement, as opposed to immediate lump-sum airdrops.
- **Example**: Consider the scenario where the longer an individual holds a community NFT, the more social tokens they accrue, discouraging immediate selling post-airdrop.

Explore this concept with the [Reverb project](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/reverb-x2kgs), a platform that streams social tokens based on music listening habits.

## Perpetual Conditional Rewards (PCR)

The PCR model within the Superfluid Protocol offers a scalable way to incentivize community actions based on specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

### Mechanism

- **Reward Distribution**: Rewards are streamed to participants based on progress towards a KPI metric.
- **Funding and Execution**: Funded through money streams and distributed using the Superfluid Instant Distribution Agreement, with KPI verification via UMA's KPI Options.

### Use Cases

- **Community Incentives**: Communities can incentivize members for activities like increasing Twitter followers or GitHub repo stars.
- **Scalable Incentives**: This system provides a method to reward members proportionally for contributing to communal goals.

Superfluid's approach to social tokens and community incentives represents a shift towards more dynamic and engagement-focused reward systems in the digital space.
