# Superfluid Host

The Superfluid Host Contract is a central element of the Superfluid Protocol, acting as a hub connecting Super Tokens, Super Agreements, and Super Apps.

Let's explore how the Host Contract interacts with different components of the Superfluid Protocol.

## Super Agreements ðŸ”— Host Contract

Super Agreements, each with their unique contracts, interface with the Host Contract. Interaction with a Super Agreement is typically done by calling [`callAgreement()`](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/solidity-examples/interacting-with-superfluid-smart-contracts) on the Host Contract, specifying the agreement and parameters.

### Key Points

- **Upgradeability and Expansion**: Super Agreements can be updated or new ones can be added and registered with the Host Contract.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: Direct interactions with Super Token contracts are not required for invoking Super Agreements. Instead, these agreements are accessed via the Host Contract, which then manages the Super Token balances involved.

## Super Tokens ðŸ”— Host Contract

Super Tokens form the foundational layer of the Superfluid Protocol, where all Super Agreement data for an account is compiled.

### Functionality

- **Aggregated Balance Calculation**: The impact of each Super Agreement on an account's balance is cumulatively calculated to determine the Super Token balance.
- **Data Sourcing**: Super Token contracts obtain necessary data through the Host Contract by iterating over the registered Super Agreements.

## Super Apps ðŸ”— Host Contract

Registration of Super Apps with the Superfluid Host is essential to enable their callback functionalities.

### Interaction Mechanics

- **Registration Requirement**: Super Apps must be registered with the Host to function correctly.
- **Callback Activation**: When a Super Agreement is engaged with a Super App, the Host Contract triggers the Super App's callbacks.

In summary, the Superfluid Host Contract is integral to the Superfluid Protocol, facilitating seamless interactions and integrations among Super Tokens, Super Agreements, and Super Apps.
