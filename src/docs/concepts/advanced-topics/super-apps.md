# Super Apps

Super Apps represents a class of smart contracts that interact seamlessly with the Superfluid Protocol, enabling dynamic responses to Money streaming or Distributions (Also called Super Agreements).

## Definition

Super Apps are smart contracts registered with the Superfluid Protocol, designed to **react to Super Agreements**. These reactions are facilitated through callbacks, allowing Super Apps to engage dynamically with the creation, modification, and termination of Super Agreements.

## **Reacting to Super Agreements**

The reactivity of Super Apps stems from **callbacks**. These are segments of code within the Super App that are triggered when a Super Agreement involving the Super App is created, updated, or deleted. Such callbacks can execute various actions, from minting NFTs to initiating new Streams (Constant Flow Agreements).

### **Example - Stream Consolidator Super App**

Consider a Super App designed to consolidate all incoming flows into a single outgoing flow to a specific account (Account Z):

1. **Incoming Flow from Account A**: Account A initiates a Money Stream to the Super App (100 USDCx/mo). The Super App, in turn, starts an outbound Stream of the same rate to Account Z.
2. **Multiple Flow Adjustments**: If Account B starts a new Money Stream to the Super App (25 USDCx/mo) and Account A adjusts its flow (to 50 USDCx/mo), the Super App responds by updating its outbound Streams accordingly.
3. **Ongoing Reactions**: The Super App continues to adapt to new Money Streams or adjustments from various accounts, maintaining a reactive outbound flow.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: For a smart contract to qualify as a Super App, it must have defined callbacks to interact with Super Agreements.

## Registering With The Protocol

Registration of a Super App with the Superfluid Protocol is crucial. This registration process involves coding the smart contract to be identifiable as a Super App within the protocol.

### Purpose of Registration

- **Protocol Recognition**: When a stream is initiated towards a contract, the Superfluid Protocol checks if the recipient is a registered Super App.
- **Callback Activation**: If identified as a Super App, the protocol activates the Super App's callbacks, enabling its reactive capabilities.

## Why Are Super Apps Needed?

Super Apps introduce a layer of programmability to Super Agreements, enhancing the potential for innovative decentralized applications (dApps).

### Potential Use Cases

- **Lending Applications**: Automate loan repayments through Streams, eliminating the need for manual transactions.
- **Subscription Services**: Enable on-chain subscriptions paid via Streams, incorporating features like automatic affiliate payouts.

Super Apps open up a realm of possibilities, combining custom logic with the functionalities of Super Agreements to craft unique and scalable dApps.
