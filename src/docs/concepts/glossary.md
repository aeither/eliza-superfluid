# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides a comprehensive overview of terms and concepts within the Superfluid ecosystem.

## General Conceptual Terms

**Superfluid Ecosystem**: The collective of users and Super Apps utilizing real-time finance through Superfluid.

**Real-Time Finance**: The movement of money on a second-by-second basis enabled by Superfluid's smart contract framework.

## Super Tokens

**Super Token**: Tokens used in all Superfluid operations. Types include ERC20 Wrapper Tokens, Pure Super Tokens, and Native Asset Super Tokens. Detailed information is available in our [Super Tokens section](../developers/super-tokens/super-tokens/).

**Wrap**: The process of converting ERC20 tokens into wrapped super tokens. This involves transferring ERC20 assets into the wrapper contract and receiving an equivalent amount of super tokens.

**Unwrap**: Converting wrapped super tokens back into their underlying ERC20 assets. This involves burning super tokens and transferring the underlying asset to the user.

**Real Time Balance**: A dynamic calculation of an account's balance, considering both Superfluid agreement logic and static token balances.

## Agreements

**Superfluid Agreement**: Additional functionalities for Super Tokens provided by the Superfluid protocol. Examples include the Constant Flow Agreement and the Instant Distribution Agreement, with potential for more in the future.

**Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)**: An agreement allowing perpetual, second-by-second movement of Super Tokens between addresses.

**Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)**: An agreement for mass dispersion of Super Tokens to multiple addresses based on distribution shares or "units" at a fixed gas cost.

**Flow**: A continuous money stream from one address to another. A sender can maintain only one flow to the same receiver per token.

**Flow Rate**: The amount of tokens sent in a stream, denominated in wei per second.

**Net Flow Rate**: The net amount of tokens sent or received per second by an account for a specific token.

**ACL (Access Control List)**: A feature enabling varying levels of control to operators for creating, updating, or deleting streams on behalf of an account.

**Index**: A pool created using the Instant Distribution Agreement.

**Publisher**: The creator of an Index.

**Units**: Shares denoting an addressâ€™s share of an IDA index, interchangeable with "distribution shares".

**Distribution**: The action of sending tokens to addresses owning shares in an index, proportionate to the number of shares held.

## Protocol

**Callback**: A function that automatically executes when specific actions are taken. Super Apps use callbacks to respond to Superfluid-related actions.

**User Data**: Data that can be included with Superfluid function calls and utilized within Super App callbacks.

**Batch Calls**: A Super Token feature allowing multiple actions to be executed in a single transaction.

**The Superfluid Host**: The core of the protocol, processing function calls and facilitating protocol governance and Super App callbacks.

**Resolver**: A contract assisting in locating all protocol constituent contract addresses.

## Sentinels & Solvency

**Buffer**: Tokens locked temporarily when a stream starts.

**Liquidation**: The process initiated by a sentinel when an account's balance reaches zero while streaming funds.

**Sentinel**: A node monitoring the Superfluid network and closing critical or insolvent streams. Anyone can run a sentinel node.

**PIC (Patrician in Charge)**: The recipient of rewards for closing streams during the priority period when an account becomes critical.

**TOGA (Transparent Ongoing Auction)**: An auction allowing individuals to become the PIC by staking a higher amount than the current PIC.

**Stake**: Funds locked in the TOGA contract by the PIC.

**Top Up**: Adding to a Super Token balance to prevent liquidation due to a zero balance.
