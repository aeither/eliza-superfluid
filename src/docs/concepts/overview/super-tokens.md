# Super Tokens

Super Tokens extend the [ERC20 token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) with additional functionalities like [Money Streaming](./money-streaming.mdx) or [Distributions](./distributions.mdx), formerly known as Super Agreements. There are two types of Super Tokens: wrapper and custom.

:::info
Super Tokens can perform all the functions of a traditional [ERC20 token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), plus additional value transfer methods enabled by Superfluid, such as money streaming.

## Wrapper Super Tokens

Wrapper Super Tokens are existing tokens wrapped to gain Superfluid functionalities. Wrapping converts the underlying token into its Super Token version, while unwrapping reverses the process.

  <p>*By wrapping the original token you obtain a SUPER TOKEN*</p>
</div>

For more informations, about the wrapping process, please refer to our [Developers Section](/docs/category/deploy-a-super-token).

## Pure Super Tokens

Pure Super Tokens are natively Superfluid-enabled without an underlying token. They offer inherent ERC20 functionalities plus Superfluid's Super Agreement capabilities.

## Real-Time Balance

Super Tokens track an account's balance dynamically, factoring in both regular transfers and impacts from Money Streaming and Distributions.

- **Static Balance**: The standard ERC20 balance affected by lump-sum transfers.
- **Real-Time Balances**: The ongoing impact of each Super Agreement on an account's balance, which can be positive or negative.

The actual current balance is a sum of these components.

> **Current Balance Formula**: Current Balance = Real-Time Balances + Static Balance

### Example Calculation

- Account A's Static Balance: 1,000 USDCx
- Account A's Stream Out: -100 USDCx
- Account A's Instant Distribution Receipts: +200 USDCx

> **Current Balance**: 1000 - 100 + 200 = **1100 USDCx**

:::info About Super Tokens `balanceOf()`
If you are familiar with the ERC20 standard, you are certainly familiar with `balanceOf()`. A Super Token `balanceOf()` function reflects this dynamic balance, unlike a regular ERC20's static approach.
